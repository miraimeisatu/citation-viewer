## Description
![Setting](./src/assets/readme_3.png)
- Each node represents a paper registered in your Paperpile, and the edges represent citation relationships. If the arrow head is A -> B, it means that the paper A refers to the paper B. If the arrow head is A -> B, it means that the paper A refers to the paper B.
- The size of the circle expresses the impact factor. Strictly speaking, it is proportional to the number of citations. It does not depend on the papers you have in Paperpile, but on the metadata you get from crossref.
- 'Fetch Success' indicates that the meta information was successfully retrieved from the DOI information registered in Paperpile.
- 'DOI not in paperpile' indicates that the DOI information was not registered in the paperpile, so the meta-information was obtained by identifying the DOI from the title.
- 'Cannot Find DOI' indicates that the DOI is not registered in the paperpile and the DOI could not be identified from the title.

## How to improve your network
- By supplementing the DOI and title information, you will have a better network.
